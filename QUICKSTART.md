## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Theme
Edit `_quarto.yml`:
```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: minty  # Try: flatly, united, cosmo, etc.
```

### Generate PDF

- `{.callout-note}` - blue boxes
- `{.callout-tip}` - green boxes
- `{.callout-warning}` - orange boxes

## 📚 Next Steps

### For Learning
1. **Read sequentially**: Start with index.qmd → Chapter 1 → ... → Exercises
2. **Use cheat sheet**: Keep it open as reference while reading
3. **Try exercises**: Do them without looking at solutions first
4. **Create examples**: Apply concepts to your own scenarios

### For Development
1. **Expand content**: Add more exercises, examples, or chapters
2. **Add code chunks**: Include R/Python calculations if needed
3. **Enhance visuals**: Create more TikZ diagrams
4. **Deploy online**: Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Render Issues
If rendering fails:
```bash
quarto check  # Verify installation
```

### Missing Diagrams
- Mermaid: Works in HTML only (not PDF)
- TikZ: Requires LaTeX for PDF rendering

### Broken Links
All internal links use relative paths and should work automatically.
